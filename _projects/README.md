## Objective

The primary objective of our project is to conduct a comprehensive customer analysis for Olist. By diving deep into the behavioral patterns, transactional data, and overall engagement of customers, we aim to derive actionable insights that can drive personalized marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and optimize resource allocation. The ultimate goal is to provide business intelligence that will empower the platform to not only meet but exceed customer expectations, thereby fostering a loyal customer base and driving sustainable growth.  

The motivation behind choosing this particular topic stems from the recognition of customers as the lifeblood of any e-commerce platform. In today's highly competitive digital marketplace, understanding customer behavior and value is vital and paramount. We were particularly drawn to the challenge of unlocking the potential within customer data, mainly in three aspects:  
* Customer EDA: By exploring and understanding the underlying patterns in customer behaviors, we can provide a general overview of the Olist e-commerce data and uncover areas of improvement within the platform, primarily based on customer geolocation distribution and customer purchase preference.  
* Customer Segmentation: By segmenting customers into meaningful groups based on their transactional behavior, we can enable targeted marketing efforts and more efficient allocation of resources, improving personalized customer experience.
* Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction: Predicting LTV is crucial for decision-making about customer acquisition and retention strategies by focusing on customers who are most likely to contribute significantly to the platformâ€™s profitability over time.

To sum up, this project is driven by the desire to derive data-driven solutions that enable the e-commerce platform to not only survive but thrive in the competitive landscape. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to the development of a more customer-centered platform that values and leverages the power of its customer data to drive decisions and strategies.
